//Baxter 6 DOF Forward Kinematics Simulation//

The Matlab scrpit simulates the Forward Kinematics of a 6 DOF Baxter arm with theta3 set to 0.

A custom GUI is created. By varying the sliders, the joint angles of the arm changes accordingly.

Note: Open all the programs in this folder at once and run the simulation.m file
